# Tomato Plant Disease Detection using Image Processing (CNN)  
This project is a deep learning-powered web application designed to detect diseases in tomato plant leaves using image processing techniques. It leverages a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a large dataset of tomato leaf images to accurately classify various diseases or identify healthy leaves. Built with Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface, the tool allows users—especially farmers, agricultural researchers, and plant pathologists—to quickly upload leaf images and receive real-time disease predictions. The goal is to provide an efficient, accessible, and affordable solution for early disease detection to help improve crop health and yield.
