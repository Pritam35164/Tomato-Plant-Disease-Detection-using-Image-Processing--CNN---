# Tomato Plant Disease Detection using CNN & Image Processing

## Overview
This project is an AI-driven web application designed to detect diseases in tomato plant leaves using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. By simply uploading an image of a leaf, users can instantly receive predictions of the plantâ€™s health condition along with confidence percentages.

This tool is particularly valuable for:
- ðŸŒ¾ Farmers
- ðŸ”¬ Researchers
- ðŸŒ± Agricultural students
- ðŸ¤– AI/ML enthusiasts

The goal is to provide a **fast, accessible, and affordable solution** for early disease detection to help improve crop yield and reduce economic losses.

## Features
- âœ… Real-time disease prediction from leaf images
- âœ… Confidence score for predictions
- âœ… Identify both **healthy** and **diseased** leaves
- âœ… Simple and intuitive Streamlit user interface
- âœ… Powered by a custom-trained deep learning model (CNN)
